This file exists solely to explain how I've designed things 
incase anyone ever wants to try to understand what is going
on behind the scenes in chisel.

===== How are files saved/loaded? =====
When I save files to memory I take each line and add it all to one string. 
There are no new-line characters saved in this process because it was
giving me issues. Instead the line-breaks are defined based on the user's
screen width and the assumption that the width has not changed between saving
and loading a document.
This may need to be changed in future since it is possible to change screen
sizes if you migrate a save, which would break your existing save images.
Layers are seperated by this frowny face character: â˜¹ 
This character isn't avaliable to the user and looks odd in game anyway so
I figured it would serve as a useful marker to seperate layers. I may use
this same trick in the future if I want to add additional detail to the 
save file.



===== Other features I may consider working on =====
 - Colour. it's something I've been thinking I could add and I have some ideas
   on how I can approach it so I may explore this idea in the future. If I do
   though I likely won't do colour layers and will instead have a single colour
   canvas that covers the whole image
 - Importing. I may add the ability to paste images into a text document to be
   later imported in-game to chisel. 
 - Exporting. This one is a lot more complicated as I don't have the ability to
   save data to the user's clipboard. The only way I've yet come up with is the
   usage of QR codes to export data but this would be tricky because I'm not a
   programmer, I hit things with a hammer for a living.
 - Animations. I don't know that I'm likely to do add this feature but in theory
   I'd like to add an option to make animations. This would include making 
   individual frames, setting animation times, and the ability to save/
   load said animations.
